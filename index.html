<p>There are many new stores popping up all around town. Here are a few:</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/HTp7Rk5.png" alt="My Magical Market"></p>
<p>When you come to My Magical Market you can get a commercial taped and sent to the news for you buisness, for only $15. 
You can also buy bracelets, charms, and much more. Or you could mail a letter to your friend. My Magical Market is also
your one stop book renting location, with books for all ages. Also, you may keep your money safe, all at
My Magical Market.

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/x9P8jYm.png" alt="Rainbow Creations"></p>
<p>In the store of Rainbow Creations, I make either a bracelet for $2, a charm for $3, or a special for $5. You get to
pick the colors and the thing you choose. I tell you when it is going to be ready and you come back to pick it up then.
If you would like to get a bracelet, charm, and a special, it is only $10. I hope to see you soon at Rainbow Creations.
